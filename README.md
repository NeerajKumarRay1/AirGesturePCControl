# AI-Powered Air Gesture-Based PC Control System

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered air gesture-based PC control system that allows users to control their computer using hand gestures. It uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to detect and interpret gestures, providing a seamless touch-free experience.

## Features

âœ… Cursor control with smoothing

âœ… Swipe detection for navigation

âœ… Two-finger scrolling

âœ… Pinch-based clicking

âœ… Brightness and volume adjustment

âœ… Custom gesture recognition with JSON configuration

âœ… Gesture logging and dynamic threshold adjustment

âœ… Frame skipping for performance optimization

âœ… Multi-threading for video capture and gesture detection

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7+ recommended).

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
